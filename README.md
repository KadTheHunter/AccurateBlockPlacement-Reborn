AccurateBlockPlacement: Reborn is a client-side mod for [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net).

[Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) is required, [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) and [Cloth Config API](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config) are optional, but strongly recommended.

*Although many experienced minecraft players know exactly how to time their clicks in order to rapidly place blocks with no mistakes, why should it be that difficult? In this mod, if you hold your 'use key' (usually RMB) and look at a new block it will automatically place it no matter how fast you move. No more need to time when you click or look in order to accurately place blocks quickly!*

## Features
**WARNING:** This mod may be considered a "cheat" on some servers (and detected as such)! Please check the server's rules before using this mod. _Use this at your own risk._

### Accurate Block Placement
Accurate Block Placement makes placing blocks a smooth and reliable process when holding right click. The best way to explain it is the following GIF:

Enabled by default, can be toggled on or off through the config or by way of a configurable keybind (default: Not Bound).

### Fast Block Breaking (v1.3.0+ for 1.21.3+)
Fast Block Breaking makes breaking blocks much easier and more consistent, by removing the Mining Cooldown when breaking blocks.

No GIF for this one yet :(, _essentially haste insta-mining but for creative mode_

Disabled by default, can be toggled on or off through the config or by way of a configurable keybind (default: Not Bound).
